        <h2>UI Developer, Designer and Engineer</h2>
        <h3>HostGator, LLC <span>May 2011 - Present</span></h3>
        <p>I was hired at Host Gator as a UI developer and was quickly promoted to the senior position, given management responsibilities and overseeing the entirety of Host Gator's UI development.</p>
        <!--<p>Upon arrival, the codebase at HostGator.com was attrocious.  Easily some of the most disgusting piles of hack and slash Perl mixed with markup, DB calls, ajax polls I've ever seen. Entire business critical applications in one 10,000 line file, dependent on other 10,000 one file applications.  It was my job to help stop this company from hemoraging money and employee's alike.</p>-->
        <p>One of my first major responsibilities was maintaining and refactoring the source of HostGator.com, which was quite exciting, as maintaining a public facing website that gets over 100,000 unique hits a month.  Over the course of a year, I've helped refactor the guts of this site in order to prepare for a seamless transition to a much more maintainable and extensible codebase.  I've since moved on from developing this project further, but still oversee this
            project</p>
        <p>Currently, I am the lead for UI/UX for the entirety of HostGator.  My biggest project right now is an all out refactor of their support system.  Our purpose is to systematically replicate and replace a number of disjointed interfaces and support tools into one work "Dashboard".  This project is particularly interesting to me because of the unique challenges we get to face developing a extremely UI feature rich business critical application.</p>

        <h2>Owner/Director of UI</h2>
        <h3>Azimuth 360, LLC <span>May 2009 - May 2011</span></h3>
        <p>Entrepreneurship is a great passion of mine, there is something to be said about being in charge of one's own destiny, sink or swim.  This venture of mine was very exciting and promising but ultimately not meant to be.  We produced quite an impressive amount of interesting software for such a young group of not-so-experienced developers.  Ultimately, this fell apart due to circumstances beyond my control.</p>
        <p>Business Analysis and Custom Software where our primary services, but we were prepared to tackle anything from mobile phone biometrics scanning to elimenating every last bit of paper work a business had one form at a time.  These were some of the most exciting moments in my professional career.</p>

            <h2>Freelance</h2>
            <h3>Me, Myself and I <span>January 2008 - Present</span></h3>
            <p>I always enjoy taking on interesting freelance work.  I'm a very adaptive engineer/developer that is comfortable working with a wide variety of systems.  If I am not familiar with your practices or technologies, I will learn them quickly. </p>
            <p> I'm particularly fond of anything that actually does good in the world.  I'm a bit of a philanthropist myself!  That being said, I typically shy away from charity work only because i find non-profits to be so dreadfully unorganized and unprepared for my services, but give a hefty discount to any properly organized groups in need.</p>
            <p>I am not actively working on any one freelance project right now, but I'm actively looking for intriguing work to take on.</p>
