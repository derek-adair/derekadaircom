                    <h1>Web Developer and Engineer</h1>
                    <p>I am a programmer with experience in all aspects of web application development, specializing in User Interface and User Experience.  I am well adjusted to adapt to changing requirements and able to prototype cross platform compliant applications rapidly with modern user interface development techniques.  I have experience in process analysis, efficiency consulting, and requirement gathering. My passion is to deliver minimalist interfaces that gets users to their goal in the most direct means possible.</p>

                    <h2>Web Application Development</h2>
                    <h3>I make the buttons work</h3>
                    <p>A lot of people don't really understand what it is I do, which isn't a problem, because a major part of my job involves communicating with the non-tech savvy folk.  I'm basically a middle man; I enable you to communicate to that smelly guy who you pay, but never actually see because he's nocturnal.  I can understand the latest tech jargon and recognize when someone can do nothing but speak it.</p>

                    <h2>Adaptive Requirements Gathering</h2>
                    <h3>Ensuring the right work gets done</h3>
                    <p>It's been my experience that many projects seem to be doomed from the start, but even more projects are doomed anytime after the that due to a developer stamping his/her feet when a client tries to sneak some last minute changes.</p>
                    <p>I don't subscribe to this methodology.  Continuous and unyielding communication is my way.  Using some pretty awesome tools, I'm able to relay the state of a project at a glance and change directions on a whim.</p>

                    <h2>Elegant Code</h2>
                    <h3>Yes, I can do that</h3>
                    <p>I may not have a nice framed piece of paper that many Developers hide behind; but while others where spending time in academia, I was on the front lines playing with the latest and greatest technologies.  I beleive my time was well spent.</p>
                    <p>The code I devleop is veristile and maintainable. With regular communication is proper planning, I'm effectively never going to say no to shape something to your will.</p>
