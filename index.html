                <h1>Web Developer and Engineer</h1>
                <p>I am a programmer with experience in all aspects of web application development, specializing in User Interface and User Experience.  I am well adjusted to adapt to changing requirements and able to prototype cross platform compliant applications rapidly with modern user interface development techniques.  I have experience in process analysis, efficiency consulting, and requirement gathering. My passion is to deliver minimalist interfaces that get users to their goal in the most direct means possible.</p>

                <h2>Web Application Development</h2>
                <h3>I make the buttons work</h3>
                <p>A lot of people don't really understand what it is I do, which isn't a problem, because a major part of my job involves communicating with the non-tech savvy folk.  I'm basically a middle man; I enable you to communicate to that smelly guy who you pay, but never actually see because he's nocturnal.  I can understand the latest tech jargon and recognize when someone can do nothing but speak it.</p>

                <h2>Adaptive Requirements Gathering</h2>
                <h3>Ensuring the right work gets done</h3>
                <p>Continuous and unyielding communication is how I achieve accurate execution of deliverables.  Using some pretty awesome tools, I'm able to relay the state of a project at a glance and change directions on a whim.</p>
                <p>With proper planning, changing requirements are not an issue.  All you have to do is ask and I will figure out how to make it happen.</p>

                <h2>Elegant Code</h2>
                <h3>Yes, I can do that</h3>
                <p>I may not have a nice framed piece of paper that many Developers hide behind; but while others were spending time in academia, I was on the front lines playing with the latest and greatest technologies.  I beleive my time was well spent.</p>
                <p>The code I devleop is versatile and maintainable. With a minor amount of training, any junior programmer could be brought up to speed on how to modify and extend the applications I construct.</p>
